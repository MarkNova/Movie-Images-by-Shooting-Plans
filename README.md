# Movie Images by Shooting Plans

I have collected about **49.000 film footages**, each of which belongs to one of the seven classes depending on the shooting plan:

- Extreme Close Up
- Close Up
- Medium Close Up
- Medium
- Medium Wide
- Wide
- Extreme Wide


You can train your own frame classification model and use it in your own projects related to content analysis, metadata creation, automation of editing processes, etc. I hope this data will be useful for you ^_ . https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minutcoff/movie-images-by-types-of-shooting-plans
